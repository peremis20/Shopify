# YoYo AK-100 — Health Quiz & Personalized Dashboard

A personalized health-quiz web app built with **Next.js + TypeScript** and
**Firebase** (Auth + Firestore). Users take a 5-step quiz, get a tailored
wellness plan and product recommendations, create an account, and revisit
everything from their own private dashboard.

The UI matches the YoYo AK-100 brand: warm cream background, deep-green
headings, orange accents, and a friendly, rounded card style.

## Features

- 🎯 **5-step quiz** — Goals → Lifestyle → Health → Preferences → Results, with
  a progress stepper and answers auto-saved as you go.
- 🧠 **Personalized plan engine** — builds a daily routine, tips, and focus
  areas from the answers (`src/lib/recommendations.ts`).
- 🛒 **Smart product recommendations** — scores the YoYo AK-100 catalog against
  the user's goals and preferences (`src/lib/products.ts`).
- 🔐 **Firebase Auth** — email/password + Google sign-in.
- 📊 **Private dashboard** — each user sees their goals, plan, health snapshot,
  and recommended products, stored per-user in Firestore.

## Tech stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (custom brand theme in `tailwind.config.ts`)
- Firebase Web SDK v11 (Auth + Firestore)

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # then fill in your Firebase keys
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

> The marketing page and quiz work without Firebase. Accounts, saving plans,
> and the dashboard activate once `.env.local` has valid keys.

## Firebase setup

1. Create a project at https://console.firebase.google.com.
2. **Authentication** → enable **Email/Password** and **Google** providers.
3. **Firestore Database** → create a database (production mode).
4. Project settings → add a **Web app** and copy the config into `.env.local`
   (see `.env.local.example`).
5. Deploy the included security rules so users can only touch their own data:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

## Data model

Firestore stores one document per user at `users/{uid}`:

```ts
{
  uid, email, displayName,
  answers,               // everything the user selected in the quiz
  plan,                  // generated routine, tips, focus areas
  recommendedProductIds, // computed product matches
  createdAt, updatedAt
}
```

## Project structure

```
src/
  app/            # routes: / (quiz), /login, /signup, /dashboard
  components/     # Navbar, Hero, Quiz, Dashboard, cards, etc.
  lib/            # firebase, auth-context, firestore, quiz-data,
                  # products, recommendations, quiz-storage
  types/          # shared TypeScript types
```

## Deploy

Deploy to any Next.js host (Vercel recommended). Add the same
`NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` environment variables in your host's dashboard.
